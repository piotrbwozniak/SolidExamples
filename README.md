# SOLID Principles Examples in C#

This repository contains simple examples demonstrating the **SOLID** principles in C# (.NET 9).  

## What is SOLID?

SOLID is an acronym for five fundamental design principles in object-oriented programming aimed at making software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

- **S** — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):  
  A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
  
- **O** — Open/Closed Principle (OCP):  
  Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  
- **L** — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):  
  Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
  
- **I** — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):  
  Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use; interfaces should be specific and fine-grained.
  
- **D** — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):  
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

## About this repository

- Each principle is illustrated with a simple, self-contained example.
- Examples show both **good** and **bad** code to clarify each principle.
- Designed as educational material for developers learning clean code and SOLID.
